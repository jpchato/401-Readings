## Linked Lists
* A linked list is a sequence of nodes that are connected to each other. Each node references the next node in the list.
* Two types of linked lists: singly and doubly
  * Singly refers to the number of references the node has. The reference points to the next node in the list.
  * Doubly refers to two references within the node. Reference to previous and next node. 
 * Nodes are individual items that live in a linked list. Nodes contain the data for each link.
