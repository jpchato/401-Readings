## Linked Lists
* A linked list is a sequence of nodes that are connected to each other. Each node references the next node in the list.
* Two types of linked lists: singly and doubly
  * Singly refers to the number of references the node has. The reference points to the next node in the list.
  * Doubly refers to two references within the node. Reference to previous and next node. 
 * Nodes are individual items that live in a linked list. Nodes contain the data for each link.
 * Next allows us to traverse linked lists. Not able to use foreach or for loop. 
 * while() is the best way to traverse a linked list.
 * set the current to the head to start form the beginning of a linked list
 * Big O of time for using includes is O(n), for space it's O(1)
 * To add a node set the current equal to head. newNode.next is then set to head.
 * use print() to print out the nodes
